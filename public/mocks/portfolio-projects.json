		"description": "I completely transformed a static website with a single 3D model into an interactive and immersive experience, inspired by the design and concept of theyearofgreta.com. Through extensive restructuring and refactoring, I integrated modern technologies such as Next.js, React, and Three.js to achieve seamless transitions, dynamic sections, and striking visual interactions. The result is a web platform for a food company that not only presents information but also engages the user in a compelling digital narrative. This project showcases my ability to redesign solutions from the ground up, enrich the user experience, and bring complex ideas to life through code.",
