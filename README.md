# My Portfolio Web âœ¨

This is my web portfolio, where you can see my projects and my skills in them and get to know me a little better

## Description ðŸ‘€

This project has two objectives:

1. Introduce myself and my most outstanding projects.
2. Serve as a template as a portfolio for any developer who sees fit

Little by little I will improve it as a template to make it more dynamic. I will always be open to advice and recommendations from the community.
